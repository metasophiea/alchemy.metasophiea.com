The way this is done it with \"unit description files\", which as the name suggests, are used to describe units. Here you describe the design of the unit, along with its name and selection space as well as some other details. You also define an executable location. This executable is run by the system and acts as the unit's internal logic. All executables are run on their own threads, and thus operate asynchronously from the main program. The program communicates with these executables through the stdio, using (currently) a JSON format. The executable is therefore able to receive information as a a series of events and can send at any time commands for the program to execute."}],["$","p",null,{"children":"This is all a little vague right now, and I have no documentation for it at all - nor any real examples beyond one testing unit - but future updates will come with a more solid API and better integration.
